# Data sets {- #data-sets}


For some of the practical  sessions we will make use of pre-prepared data. You will find all data required for the second phase of the practicals in the data folder [here](https://github.com/anasrana/module1-practical_Bham/tree/master/data) and you can download [here](https://github.com/anasrana/ems-practicals/raw/main/data.zip).

You can download files individually from the website, or using bash commands by either going to the terminal tab on `RStudio` or by opening a dedicated terminal. You can either copy all data Navigate to the folder you want to download your data into, and use the following commands:

## Data: Linear regression {- #data-lr}
